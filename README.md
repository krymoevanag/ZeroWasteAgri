# ZeroWasteAgri
ZeroWasteAgri is a data-driven solution to track, analyze, and reduce food waste in agriculture. It uses SQL databases, Python analytics, and Excel dashboards to monitor waste, optimize storage, and improve market access. The project supports SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption &amp; Production) for a sustainable food system. 🌱📊♻️

📌 Problem Definition: Sustainable Agriculture in Kenya Amidst Unpredictable Rainfall Patterns

1️⃣ Background
Agriculture is the backbone of Kenya’s economy, contributing approximately 33% of the GDP and employing over 40% of the total population. Smallholder farmers, who produce about 75% of the country’s food, are the most affected by climate change, particularly unpredictable rainfall patterns.

Traditionally, regions like Rift Valley, Central Kenya, Eastern Kenya, and parts of Western Kenya have relied on rain-fed agriculture. However, climate change has disrupted normal weather patterns, causing erratic rainfall, prolonged droughts, and unexpected floods. These challenges have led to:

Disrupted planting and harvesting schedules 🌱
Crop failures, food shortages, and economic losses for farmers 📉
Increased vulnerability of smallholder farmers to food insecurity and financial instability


2️⃣ Problem Statement
Kenyan smallholder farmers face severe challenges in adapting to unpredictable climatic conditions. The inconsistency in rainfall patterns has resulted in:

🔴 Reduced crop yields due to late or inadequate rainfall 🌱
🔴 Water scarcity for irrigation, leading to crop failure during dry spells 💧
🔴 Soil degradation from excessive dry periods or soil erosion caused by heavy rains 🌍
🔴 Post-harvest losses due to poor storage facilities and lack of access to reliable markets 📉
🔴 Limited access to mechanization for efficient land preparation, planting, and irrigation 🚜
🔴 Lack of training and knowledge on climate-smart agriculture techniques 📚

Without effective, data-driven solutions, farmers continue to rely on outdated farming methods that no longer align with the changing climate. As a result, they struggle with low productivity, poor resilience, and financial instability.


3️⃣ Objectives
This project aims to develop a data-driven solution to promote sustainable agriculture in Kenya by:

✅ Building a relational database to track farmer data, farm inputs, water resources, and market trends 📊
✅ Providing essential farm resources, including machinery, water storage tanks, quality seeds, and fertilizers to enhance agricultural resilience 🚜
✅ Leveraging SQL queries and Excel dashboards to analyze and visualize key agricultural metrics, such as rainfall trends and crop productivity 📈
✅ Enhancing irrigation systems to reduce reliance on rainfall and promote year-round farming 💧
✅ Empowering farmers through training programs on climate-smart agricultural techniques 🌱


🌍 Expected Impact
By integrating data, technology, and sustainable practices, this project will:

Improve food security by boosting farm productivity
Increase farmer incomes through better market access and resource management
Promote sustainable agriculture to mitigate the effects of climate change
This initiative will enable Kenyan farmers to adapt to unpredictable weather patterns, ensuring long-term agricultural sustainability and economic stability in the sector.
